# Task Separator - separate your tasks in the easiest way!

This project is basically for my use. I want to create a flutter productivity app which will work very simple - You press the button to start the timer, then it will show your current task, next tasks and time left. It will contain things like authentication, forms etc. Feel free to view my code!

Currently there's no link to the app.

## What kind of technologies did I use?

- Flutter
- Dart
- Firebase
- Cloud Firestore
